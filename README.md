An improvement of attention based CNN.  
Today microblogging services are used my millions of  
people, who use them for making short posts. The users  
also can include hashtags in their text. A hashtag is a string  
with a hash symbol in front of the words, commonly used  
for expressing the main idea of the text. With an enormous  
increase in microblogging services usage among social nets  
hashtags attract more attention as efficient tools for data  
mining such as public opinion analysis, microblog retrieval,  
prediction, etc.  
The problem is, that there is a small number of posts with  
hashtags made by the authors. Thus and automated hashtag  
recomendation became an interesting area for research.
